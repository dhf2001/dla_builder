- [x] Make Quadtree an enumerable, and use the same interface for both LinearGrower and QuadtreeGrower
- [ ] Pull the particles argument out of the options hash now that it's standardized across growers
- [ ] Factor out a common superclass to LinearGrower and QuadtreeGrower
- [ ] Factor a helper class out of QuadtreeGrower to encapsulate a single particle step (QuadtreeStepper or something)
- [ ] Make a two dimensional range intersection calculator (AreaIntersectionCalculator?)
- [ ] Make a non application-specific directory (lib or something) and put the intersection calculators in it
