- [ ] Convert the assertions that used to be in linear_grower_test to integration tests
- [ ] Stop mocking Particle in dla.rb (it's gotten out of hand)
- [ ] Pull the particles argument out of the Grower options hash since it's required
- [ ] Make a two dimensional range intersection calculator (AreaIntersectionCalculator?) -- relates to AxisAlignedBoundingBox
- [ ] Make a non application-specific directory (lib or something) and put the intersection calculators in it
- [ ] Pass DLA extent in to the grower
- [ ] Audit command query separation violations
- [ ] Implement a true visitor pattern and implement rendering that way
