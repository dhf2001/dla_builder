- [ ] Incrementally calculate the minimum bounding box
- [ ] DRY the top corner -> center coordinate system transformation
- [ ] Convert the assertions that used to be in linear_grower_test to integration tests
- [ ] Figure out where Renderer belongs and if it should be tested
- [ ] Test block yielding in Grower with minitest stubs
- [ ] Test Dla#particles reader
- [ ] Revisit TreePropertyCalculator interface
- [ ] Make QuadtreeClosestParticleFinder#closest_particle yield the found particle rather than return it
- [ ] Check for a performance regression from before the Vector/Point/Particle split
- [ ] Audit convenience constructors to minimize new object creation
- [ ] Audit bracket initializers -- remove where there isn't much value
- [ ] Reimplement BoundingBox with a vector of ranges
