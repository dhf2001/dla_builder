- [ ] Make QuadtreeClosestParticleFinder#closest_particle yield the found particle rather than return it
- [ ] Check for a performance regression from before the Vector/Point/Particle split
- [ ] Audit convenience constructors to minimize new object creation
- [ ] Audit bracket initializers -- remove where there isn't much value
- [ ] Reimplement BoundingBox with a vector of ranges
- [ ] Factor out tree structure responsibility from the Particle class
